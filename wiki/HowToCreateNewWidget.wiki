Thanks for your consideration to contribute to the project, 
we assumed that you have gone through the [Architecture] document 
and have basic understanding of the design of the Form Builder plugin 
prior to reading this document.

Also, before you can create a server-side widget, you need to create the 
equivalent client-side field first by refer to 
[How To Create New Field http://code.google.com/p/jquery-form-builder-plugin/wiki/HowToCreateNewField]

= How To Create New Widget In 2 Steps =
1. Create the equivalent Groovy class for the corresponding [http://code.google.com/p/jquery-form-builder-plugin JQuery Form Builder's] field. The name of Groovy class must be same with value specified in `options._type` property of the field. You can refer to the [http://code.google.com/p/grails-form-builder-plugin/wiki/WidgetAPI Widget API documentation] and [http://code.google.com/p/grails-form-builder-plugin/source/browse/trunk/src/groovy/org/grails/formbuilder/widget/PlainText.groovy Plain Text] or [http://code.google.com/p/grails-form-builder-plugin/source/browse/trunk/src/groovy/org/grails/formbuilder/widget/SingleLineText.groovy Single Line Text] implementation.  
2. Add the necessary widget-specific configuration under `formBuilder` block in Config.groovy file for testing and update `_Install.groovy` script upon completion. For example, the following code is configuration of Single Line Text:
{{{
formBuilder {
    ...
	SingleLineText {
		type = 'String'
		defaultConstraints = [maxSize: 255]
	}
}
}}}
